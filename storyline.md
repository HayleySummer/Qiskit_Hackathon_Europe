## Introduction: 
When we think of AI in video games, we think of non-player characters, which are characters with intelligence that evolve with or against the player during the game. These programs are driven by specific statistical algorithms: we can mention the Finite State Machine and Monte Carlo Search Tree models, which give the illusion of a reactive and adaptive intelligence. These algorithms, however sophisticated, do not use the most advanced AI technologies.
And to continue to introduce the capabilities of artificial intelligence, Demis Hassabis then spoke about DeepBlue, a chess supercomputer developed by IBM in the 1990s. If it was perfected, it could only do one thing: play chess. It couldn't even perform a simpler task. That's why Demis Hassabis' team decided to tackle a more complex board game that would allow the knowledge gathered in the game to be reused for other tasks: the game of Go.
