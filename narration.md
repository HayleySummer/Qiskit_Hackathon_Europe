Games in AI ->
Games have always played an important role in AI research. They have a set of defined rules and an isolated environment etc.

DeepBlue/Watson/AlphaGo ->
the best example of this are the representatives machines like DeepBlue/Watson/AlphaGo. These machines combine great computing power and machine learning techniques to learn from humans in specialized fields. In the field of games, they beat professionals in Jeopardy, Go or chess.

Quantum Computing ->
The greatest computing power so far is expected to come from Quantum Computing.
Something about finding a better solution and even more ways to reach the perfect game?

Our Approach ->
Our Approach uses the best of both Worlds: Reinforcement learning powered by Quantum Machanics.

short explanation of our architecture/software structure

Last Words:
AI in Gaming was often just the first step for machines in order to create something bigger. Our approach makes a contribution to this exciting field of AI powered by quantum machanics and controlled by Qiskit.
